i included a compiled version and the source files.  it expects the first argument to be a formula string, and allows a second argument for verbosity.

ex: "java cfnga '(-c v a) ^ b ^ (d v e) ^ -d ^ (f v c) ^ g'"
    "java cfnga '(-c v a) ^ b ^ (d v e) ^ -d ^ (f v c) ^ g' 1" for verbosity 1
    "java cfnga '(-c v a) ^ b ^ (d v e) ^ -d ^ (f v c) ^ g' 2" for verbosity 2

i assumed that the variable inputs should always be single, lower case characters starting with 'a', and never skipping the next character in line (e.g. ['a','b','c','d'], not ['a','b','c','e'] or ['b','c','d','e']).

i've updated the previous submission so that there cannot be the same candidate in the population as both parents.

i've also updated the getFitness() method since the last submission to use the HashSet objects in a more efficient manner.


i am using a particular method for selectParent() that is meant to have selection based purely upon their fitness and not skewed by their position in the Population.candidates[] array.  there is a note above the method that explains my reasoning better.

at the top of cnfga.java's main() are the pop_size and max_gens variables for you to manipulate.  i wanted to just have those be input variables for you to adjust but i didn't get around to setting that up.
